"""Pillar 2 > Information (/wta/PillarTwoInformation). Confirmed live: a
left "Jurisdictions and Categories" panel (jurisdiction list + a FLAT list
of 9 GMT categories: Scope of GMT, Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), Undertaxed
Profits Rule (UTPR), Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT), Safe
Harbours under GloBE Rule, Filing obligations of GMT, Penalties under GMT,
Payment obligations of GMT, Qualified Refundable Tax Credits under GMT).
Selecting a jurisdiction AND a category renders a "Showing information of

Information page, but without a nested tree (flat categories only)."""
